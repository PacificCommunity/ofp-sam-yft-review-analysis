# YFT Review Analysis

1. Plot both 2017 and 2020 diagnostic, as a starting point for stepwise analysis

2. Share stepwise findings with colleagues

3. Create a doitall that runs the 2020 diagnostic
   * find R analyses required
   * interleave MFCL and R calls

4.  Send 2020 diagnostic run to John
    * converting it to catch conditioning

5. Make sure we can run the 2017 diagnostic

6. From the 2017 diagnostic, run one-off steps:
   * 2017 diagnostic + selectivities
   * 2017 diagnostic + otoliths
   * 2017 diagnostic + tags
   * 2017 diagnostic + age10

7. From the 2017 diagnostic, run combinations:
   * selectivities + otoliths + tags

8. From the 2017 diagnostic, run new selectivity options:
   * intermediate steps, e.g., between diagnostic and selectivities
   * think of alternative ways to model the selectivities

9. Tease apart the CondAge stepwise model run:
   * otoliths
   * catchability constant between seasons
   * catchability constant between years
   * maturity not converted to age

10. Ask how to change regional structure
