# YFT Review Analysis

1. Plot and compare 2017 diagnostic and 2020 IdxNoEff

2. Add most important 2020 stepwise model runs to the plot

3. Create a doitall that runs the 2020 diagnostic

4. Make sure we can run the 2017 diagnostic

5. From the 2017 diagnostic, run one-off steps:
   * 2017 diagnostic + selectivities
   * 2017 diagnostic + otoliths
   * 2017 diagnostic + jttp

6. From the 2017 diagnostic, run combinations:
   * selectivities + otoliths + jttp

7. From the 2017 diagnostic, run new selectivity options:
   * intermediate steps between diagnostic and ungroupedsel
   * think of alternative ways to model the selectivities

8. Ask how to change regional structure
