# Stepwise Model Runs from 2020

The changes introduced in the 2020 assessment that had the greatest effect on
depletion were:

## 1 Selectivity (**SelUngroup**)

- Separation of selectivity patterns among regions.

- Assigning non-decreasing penalty to one fishery per region.

## 2 Tags (**JPTP**)

- Forcing the mixing period of the tag recaptures to be 2 quarters for each tag
release had the largest effect on this combined step.

- Inclusion of tags without recapture locations in the purse seine fisheries.

- Addition of the Japanese tagging program data.

## 3 Maximum age (**Age10LW**)

- Increasing the maximum age in the model from 7 years to 10 years.

- Updating *a* and *b* from regression including ages 7 to 10.

## 4 Growth (**CondAge**)

- Addition of otolith data through conditional age-at-length.

- Removal of deviates from the growth curve for the first 8 age classes.

- (Allow all growth parameters to be fixed during the control phase.)
