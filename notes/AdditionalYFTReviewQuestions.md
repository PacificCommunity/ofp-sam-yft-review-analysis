## Summary Report from 2020 yellowfin tuna stock assessment

Source [SC16 Summary report](https://meetings.wcpfc.int/file/10413/download) - 6 Nov 2020



[YFT Review Questions] (https://github.com/PacificCommunity/ofp-sam-yft-review/blob/main/notes/questions.md) already cover many of these issues.

Detailed comments extracted from the Summary report follow:

### 3.2.1 Review of 2020 yellowfin tuna stock assessment

#### Executive summary item 36 

Items for internal investigation of the assessment model

  - a)	Selectivity (B5)
  - b)	Effort creep (J1)
  - c)	Mixing period (E1)
  - d)  Self scaling multinomial - Dirichlet multinomial is covered under (G3). **SSMult** is not covered here - but there were some problems getting this to work. 
  - e)  Reduction in model complexity (K1)
  - f)  Comparison among tropical tuna assessments to ensure biological realism in assessment estimates of all species (?)
  - g)  Incorporation of spatial functionality of population dynamics regarding regional growth, maturity and/or length-weight (?)
  - h)	Estimation of natural mortality using available tagging data (?)
  
#### Executive summary item 37 
  
Items that require directed research and additional funding - a wish list?
  
  - a)	Evaluation of the feasibility of conducting a fishery independent survey across the WCPO to be used as an index of abundance within the stock assessments and to improve the representativeness of biological samples across the WCPO;
  - b) Further collection of otolith samples for use in investigations of regional differences in growth with increased focus on increasing the spatial coverage of sampling for all lengths and collecting fish less than 30 cm and greater than 120 cm in all regions;
  - c) Validation of otolith aging techniques through bomb radiocarbon and strontium chloride tagging to clarify causes of discrepancy between growth curves from otoliths, tagging increments, and size composition modal progression;
  - d) Additional tag seeding experiments required for the estimation of reporting rates necessary to provide better estimates of natural mortality from tagging data;
  - e) Collection of biological information to inform the components in the reproductive potential ogive such as fecundity, proportion female at length, maturity at length, and spawning fraction in a spatially structured context;
  - f) Collection of biological samples for the estimation of conversion factors from length to weight, gilled-gutted to whole-weight, and gilled-gutted-trunked to whole weight to be used for the weight composition data
  
  
###   3.2.2 Provision of scientific information b. Management advice and implications

#### Executive summary item 51

SC16 also noted that levels of fishing mortality and depletion differ between regions, and that fishery impact was highest in the tropical region (Regions 3, 4, 7 and 8 in the stock assessment model), mainly due to the purse seine fisheries in the equatorial Pacific and the “other” fisheries within the Western Pacific. There is also evidence that the overall stock status is buffered with biomass kept at a more elevated level overall by low exploitation in the temperate regions (1, 2, 5, 6, and 9). SC16 therefore re-iterates that WCPFC17 could consider measures to reduce fishing mortality from fisheries that take juveniles, with the goal to increase fishery yields and reduce any further impacts on the spawning potential for this stock in the tropical regions. 

#### Executive summary item 53 

SC16 also noted that although the structural uncertainty grid presents a positive indication of stock status, the high level of unresolved conflict amongst the data inputs used in the assessment suggests additional caution may be appropriate when interpreting assessment outcomes to guide management decisions.
