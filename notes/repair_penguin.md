We want a stepwise folder on Penguin that contains the stepwise model runs
producing the stepwise plot from the report.

The second stepwise plot (Fig. 14b) in the report has 9 model runs. We will copy
those 9 model runs to Penguin:

Model run  | Origin
---------- | ------------------
IdxNoEff   | Hopeful/Step8NoEff
SelUngroup | hopeful
JPTP       | selstep
Age10LW    | hopeful + selstep
CondAge    | selstep
MatLength  | selstep
NoSpnFrac  | selstep
Size60     | altdiag
Diag20     | diagnostic
