# CPUE vs Biomass

## How to run

Install the TAF package from CRAN. Then open R in the `cpue_vs_biomass`
directory and run:

```
library(TAF)
taf.bootstrap()
sourceAll()
```

## Explore results

After running the analysis, the resulting plot appears in the `report` folder,
to paste into a report, while intermediate tables can be found inside the other
folders.

The entire analysis is scripted and the results can be traced back to the
initial data and through the analytical steps in the TAF scripts.
