## The models

* `09_IdxNoeff`- before important model changes are made
* `10_SelUngroup` - ungroup fleet selectivities between regions
* `11_JPTP` - add JPTP tagging data, change mixing period to 2 quarters
* `12_Age10LW` - increase max age from 7 to 10 years
* `13_CondAge` - add otolith data, deterministic von Bertalanffy for all ages
* `14_MatLength` - calculate maturity at age internally in the assessment model given the growth curve
* `15_NoSpnFrac` - spawning fraction removed from the calculation of reproductive potential ogive
* `16_Size60` - use size composition downweighting divisor of 60
* `17_Diag20` - set selectivity at < 30 cm to zero for purse seine and pole-and-line
